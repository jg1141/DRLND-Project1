# DRLND-Project1
DRLND Project 1 - Navigation (Banana environment)

---

The notebook and Python files in this repository present a solution using the Unity ML-Agents environment for the first project of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

### Install the Anaconda distribution of Python 3

[Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) installation.

### Obtain Unity ML-Agents

Install [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).

### Start Jupyter and open Project 1 Notebook

```
> jupyter notebook
```

[DRLND Project 1 - Navigation (Banana environment).ipynb](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/DRLND%20Project%201%20-%20Navigation%20(Banana%20environment)/DRLND%20Project%201%20-%20Navigation%20(Banana%20environment).ipynb) - link for use on your localhost:8888 Jupyter instance

Follow instructions there to obtain the Unity3D Banana environment from Udacity.
